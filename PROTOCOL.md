# Heimdall Token-Frugal Protocol — v2.0.0

**Spec:** heimdall-core-spec §H-4 · **Status:** build-ready · **Supersedes:** 2D

The protocol that cuts main↔spawn token traffic to near zero by **compression
through reference, never obscurity**. Every message is human-readable; the full
trail lives in `.planning/protocol.log`. There is no encryption and there are no
opaque codes — auditability is the trust story. The savings are a **measured,
screenshotable number** (the token ledger), reported separately from caveman's
75%.

This document is a first-class, semantically versioned artifact. The version
above (`2.0.0`) is stamped into every state file (`symbols.json`,
`blackboard.json`, `baselines.json`) and into the message schema's `$id`. Bump
**major** on a breaking message-shape change, **minor** on an additive field or
mechanism, **patch** on a fix that preserves the wire format.

---

## Why

A v1 ("verbatim") orchestrator restates the plan, the acceptance criteria, and
prior-wave context into every spawn brief. Three spawns in a wave → the plan is
paid for three times; ten waves → thirty times. That is the orchestration token
tax this protocol exists to kill. The fix is six stacked mechanisms, each of
which replaces restated bytes with an **ID reference** that resolves to the same
human-readable content on demand.

| # | Mechanism        | Bin                   | What it removes from the wire                          |
|---|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Typed messages   | `heimdall-validate`   | Free-form prose; every message is a validated shape referencing artifacts by ID. |
| 2 | Symbol table     | `heimdall-resolve`    | Repeated file paths / criteria / invariants → short IDs. |
| 3 | Context capsules | `heimdall-capsule`    | Re-explained prior work → a ≤10-line capsule, hydrated only when referenced. |
| 4 | Delta briefs     | `heimdall-brief`      | The whole plan + restated criteria in a spawn brief.   |
| 5 | Blackboard       | `heimdall-blackboard` | Re-discovered facts (ports, versions, env quirks).     |
| 6 | Token ledger     | `heimdall-ledger`     | The unmeasured savings claim — replaced by a real number. |

The umbrella `heimdall-protocol` dispatches to all of the above and adds
`init`, `log`, and a measured `demo`.

## Layout (created by `heimdall-protocol init`)

```
.planning/
├─ protocol.log              # human-readable, append-only audit trail (tab-separated)
├─ blackboard.json           # mechanism 5: shared key→value facts
└─ protocol/
   ├─ symbols.json           # mechanism 2: id→artifact table
   ├─ message-schema.json    # mechanism 1: the published message contract
   ├─ baselines.json         # mechanism 6: v1 baselines to beat
   ├─ ledger.jsonl           # mechanism 6: one JSON token-cost line per message/spawn
   └─ capsules/{id}.md       # mechanism 3: ≤10-line context capsules
```

`HEIMDALL_PLANNING_DIR` overrides the `.planning` root (used by the test suite to
run against an isolated fixture tree). Every bin requires `jq`; absence is a hard
exit 2. macOS bash 3.2 compatible.

---

## 1 — Typed messages with ID references

Six message types, discriminated by `type`. Each references artifacts by ID and
never restates their bodies. The contract is `bin/protocol/message-schema.json`
(JSON-Schema draft-07); it is enforced by `bin/protocol/validate.jq`, kept in
lockstep with the schema (jq has no built-in schema engine and we do not assume
`ajv`/`python` are installed, so the constraints are re-stated in jq).

| `type`        | required (beyond `type`,`from`,`msg_id`) | references |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|------------|
| `task_claim`  | `task`                                   | `symbols[]`, `capsules[]` |
| `task_result` | `task`, `status∈{pass,fail,partial}`     | `criteria[]` (int IDs), `commit`, `capsule` |
| `gate_report` | `gate_id`, `status∈{pass,fail}`          | `report_ref` (path, not body) |
| `escalation`  | `reason`, `severity∈{blocker,warning,info}` | `refs[]` |
| `question`    | `question`                               | `refs[]` |
| `checkpoint`  | `wave`, `state∈{started,in_progress,complete,blocked}` | `capsules[]` |

```bash
echo '{"type":"task_result","from":"coder","msg_id":"m1","task":"3.2","status":"pass","criteria":[1,2],"commit":"a2ef507"}' \
  | heimdall-validate            # → {"valid":true,"errors":[]}, exit 0
```

**Validate-on-receipt** (`heimdall-validate --on-receipt`, reads one message per
stdin line): a malformed/invalid message gets **one** retry (the next line); a
second failure **escalates** (logs to `protocol.log`, exits nonzero). This is the
spec's "malformed → one retry → escalate" rule.

## 2 — Symbol table

Plan-time `symbols.json` assigns short IDs to recurring artifacts. Written once,
referenced thousands of times — the table *is* the compression. Human-readable
both directions.

```bash
heimdall-resolve set F12 "src/matching/engine.ts"
heimdall-resolve set C3  "balances sum to zero"
heimdall-resolve F12                       # → src/matching/engine.ts
heimdall-resolve C3                        # → balances sum to zero
heimdall-resolve --reverse "src/matching/engine.ts"   # → F12
heimdall-resolve list                      # → id<TAB>value for the whole table
```

## 3 — Context capsules

Every completed task/wave compacts to a **≤10-line** capsule (`what`, `where`,
`decision`, `gotcha`, plus a `depends` line). The cap is enforced — a capsule
that would exceed 10 lines is rejected, forcing real compaction.

Hydration emits **only the transitive `depends` closure** of the referenced
capsules — the orchestrator computes the dependency set; nothing else enters
context. This is the context-decay fix and the token fix in one mechanism.

```bash
heimdall-capsule write w1 --what "added LOB engine" --where F12 --gotcha "seed must be fixed"
heimdall-capsule write w2 --what "added book diff"  --where F13 --depends w1
heimdall-capsule write w3 --what "unrelated docs"   --where README
heimdall-capsule hydrate w2     # emits w1 then w2 — NOT w3 (not a dependency)
heimdall-capsule deps w2        # → the closure ids only
```

## 4 — Delta briefs

A spawned agent's brief = task spec + the referenced symbol entries + the
hydrated capsule closure + an invariants ref. **Never** the plan, prior
conversation, or restated criteria.

```bash
heimdall-brief build --task 3.2 --spec "implement book diff" \
  --symbols F12,C3 --capsules w2 --invariants INVARIANTS.md
```

The brief resolves only the few symbols the task names and hydrates only the
referenced capsules' closure — a planted `PLAN-*.md` body never appears in it.

## 5 — Blackboard

Shared key→value facts discovered once, read by key — kills the "every agent
rediscovers the dev-server port" tax.

```bash
heimdall-blackboard set dev_port 5173
heimdall-blackboard set node_version 20.11.0
heimdall-blackboard get dev_port           # → 5173
heimdall-blackboard list                   # → key<TAB>value
```

## 6 — Token ledger

Every message/spawn logs its token cost by role to `ledger.jsonl`. `report`
gives per-role totals for the run; `baseline` records the v1 number to beat;
`delta` computes the **measured** savings — no hardcoded percentage.

```bash
heimdall-ledger log --role orchestration --kind delta_brief --tokens 3300 --msg-id b1
heimdall-ledger baseline --role orchestration --tokens 41000
heimdall-ledger delta --role orchestration
#   orchestration: 41000 -> 11250 tokens (v1 baseline -> measured; -73%)
```

### Measured demo

`heimdall-protocol demo` runs one wave (orchestrator briefs 3 delta-spawns +
collects 3 typed results) under a v1 baseline vs this protocol, and lets the
ledger compute the delta:

```
v1 orchestration (briefing 3 spawns, verbatim): 41000 tokens (baseline)
v2 orchestration (symbol table + 3 delta briefs + 3 typed results): 11250 tokens
measured delta: orchestration: 41000 -> 11250 tokens (-73%)
```

The summary-card line: **`orchestration: 41k → 11250 tokens, measured`**.

---

## The contract-consuming adapter (built last, kept thinnest)

`heimdall-gate` is the **only** protocol component that reads `report.json`
(`evals/oracles/REPORT-CONTRACT.md`). Everything else is contract-independent, so
if a review finds a flaw in the report contract the rework is contained to this
one file. It reads only the gate-agnostic H-1 fields it is allowed to depend on
(`gate_id`, `status`, `wave` — **not** the open-keyed `metrics`) and emits a
schema-valid `gate_report` message that **references the report by path**
(`report_ref`), never inlining its body.

```bash
heimdall-gate to-message --report evals/oracles/exchange-lob/report.json \
  --from sentinel-bloat --msg-id g1 | heimdall-validate   # → valid gate_report
```

---

## Auditability

Every action appends one plain-text, tab-separated line to `.planning/protocol.log`:

```
2026-06-11T12:07:27Z	validate	accept	m1
2026-06-11T12:07:27Z	ledger	log	coder/task_result=250
```

Nothing is encoded. `heimdall-protocol log [N]` tails it.

---

## Verification

`bin/protocol/test-protocol.sh` drives every mechanism end-to-end against an
isolated fixture planning tree (55 assertions): syntax, init, resolve
forward/reverse, blackboard set/get, capsule ≤10-line cap + dependency-only
hydration, validate accept/reject + on-receipt retry/escalate, delta-brief
plan-exclusion, ledger measured delta, and the gate adapter's reference-only
`gate_report`. Exit 0 iff all pass.

# MCP Interop Contract — `heimdall-ledger-mcp` — v1.0.0

**Spec:** heimdall-team-spec §T-4 · **Status:** build-ready · **Transport:** MCP
stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 (protocol revision `2024-11-05`)

`bin/heimdall-ledger-mcp` exposes the Coordination Ledger (T-2) and the HAID
attribution backbone (T-1) over the **Model Context Protocol**, so *any* MCP
client — Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or a bespoke agent — can join the
same git-native coordination surface. It is a **thin wrapper**: every claim and
identity mutation shells out to `bin/heimdall-claim` and `bin/heimdall-haid`, the
single sources of truth. The server reimplements none of their logic.

## Why this is a protocol, not a feature

A coordination ledger that competitors can *adopt* over a published, versioned
wire contract is a **standard**, not a vendor feature. This is the
platform-absorption counter: if the big editors speak this contract, then
attribution and collision-prevention live in the open — not inside one vendor's
walls, where a platform owner could absorb and close them. The tool schema below
is the first-class public artifact, **semver-versioned** independently of the
token-frugal protocol above. Bump **major** on a breaking tool-shape change,
**minor** on an additive tool or field, **patch** on a fix that preserves the
wire shape. Current: **`1.0.0`** (`serverInfo.version`).

## Identity model

Each connecting client declares itself once at `initialize`
(`clientInfo.name` → `cursor` / `copilot` / `claude-code` / …) or per call via a
`client_identity` argument. The server derives a **spawn HAID** `{root}/{client}`
through `heimdall-haid spawn <client>` and registers it active via
`heimdall-haid register`. The role suffix (`/cursor`, `/copilot`) is the durable
distinguisher between clients in both the HAID and the registry `role` field, so
the ledger names the exact agent that acted. Every tool result echoes the
attributed HAID.

## Handshake

```
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize",
   "params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","clientInfo":{"name":"cursor"}}}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05",
   "capabilities":{"tools":{"listChanged":false}},
   "serverInfo":{"name":"heimdall-ledger-mcp","version":"1.0.0"}, ...}}
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}        # → the 6 tools below
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"...","arguments":{...}}}
```

Stdio framing: both **newline-delimited JSON** and **`Content-Length:`-framed**
(LSP-style) requests are accepted on read; responses are line-delimited. Also
implements `ping`.

## Tools (6)

| Tool | Required args | Optional args | Delegates to / writes |
|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| `read_claims` | — | `client_identity` | `heimdall-claim list --json` → active claims + count |
| `make_claim` | `surfaces[]`, `task` | `ttl_minutes`, `client_identity` | `heimdall-claim claim` — collision gate enforced; client HAID woven into `task_ref` |
| `release_claim` | — | `haid`, `client_identity` | `heimdall-claim release` |
| `read_capsules` | — | `id`, `client_identity` | reads `.planning/ledger/completed/*.md` + `.planning/protocol/capsules/*.md` (H-4) |
| `append_decision` | `title`, `body` | `client_identity` | appends a HAID-attributed entry to `decisions.md` (append-only) |
| `raise_conflict_pr` | `id`, `title`, `surfaces[]` | `displaced_haid`, `overriding_intent`, `displaced_intent`, `client_identity` | authors `conflicts/{date}-{id}.md`, cross-links from `decisions.md`, returns the PR path |

Every tool also accepts `client_identity` (a per-call override of the
initialize-time identity) for HAID attribution. Results are returned as a JSON
`text` content block plus a `structuredContent` mirror, so both text-only and
structured MCP clients work.

```bash
# Round-trip: claim via MCP, see it through the CLI single-source-of-truth.
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"clientInfo":{"name":"cursor"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"make_claim","arguments":{"surfaces":["src/a/**"],"task":"T-9"}}}' \
  | bin/heimdall-ledger-mcp
bin/heimdall-claim list      # → the claim, task_ref carries the cursor HAID
```

## Client registration (`.mcp.json`)

A drop-in `.mcp.json` at the repo root registers the server with any MCP host:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "heimdall-ledger": { "command": "bin/heimdall-ledger-mcp" } } }
```

Point Cursor / Copilot / Claude Code at it; the host speaks `initialize` →
`tools/list` → `tools/call` and the client joins the ledger with full attribution.
