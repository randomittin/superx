# Project Conventions (managed by superx)

## Rules
- All code, configs, docs go in this project directory
- Planning state lives in `.planning/` (human-readable, git-committed)
- Each completed task = one atomic git commit
- Acceptance criteria must be runnable (grep, curl, test commands)

## Quality Gates (enforced before git push)
- All tests passing
- Lint clean (zero warnings)
- Code review completed
- No untested changes

## Code Quality — Zero Tolerance
- NEVER write stub, dummy, placeholder, shim, mock, TODO, or skeleton code
- Every line must be real, working, production-ready
- No `// TODO: implement`, no `pass`, no empty function bodies, no fake data
- If you cannot implement something fully, say so — do not fake it

## Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer small, focused files over large monoliths
- Name things clearly — a reader should understand without context

## Edit Verification
- All Write/Edit ops auto-logged by `edit-tracker` (PostToolUse hook)
- Run `verify-edits` to check all session edits: file existence, stub detection, git diff
- Run `verify-edits --quick` for fast check, `--diff` for full diffs, `--json` for structured output
- `edit-tracker summary` shows files edited + operation counts
- `edit-tracker paths` lists unique edited file paths
- SessionEnd auto-runs `verify-edits --quick`

## Token Efficiency
- Caveman ultra mode active: terse output, abbreviations, arrows for causality
- Drop articles, filler, hedging — code and paths stay exact
