# Heimdall conventions — process distillations

Lessons that survived an incident, written as enforceable rules. Each one exists
because skipping it produced (or nearly produced) a false-green. Append-only.

## R5 — no hand-derived reference byte is trusted until externally anchored

A reference value (a golden trace byte, an expected trade, any "this is the
correct answer" datum) is NOT trusted until it has been anchored to an EXTERNAL
source — Pan Docs, gameboy-doctor output, an independent reference matcher —
that is independent both of the author and of this repo's other fixtures.

**Why:** the R-1 H-flag defect. The emulator golden shipped `F:10` where `F:20`
was correct (post `AND A`: H is bit 5 = `0x20`, C is bit 4 = `0x10`; AND sets H
and clears C, so the golden had the two bits inverted). It survived every
in-repo check: self-verify 11/11, mutation-proof 9/9, corpus 100%. All of those
were authored by the same hand against the same wrong reference, so they shared
its blind spot by construction — a same-author cross-check can only confirm
internal consistency, never external correctness. The defect was caught only by
an external adversarial review that anchored the byte to Pan Docs.

**How to apply:** before pinning any reference datum, cite the external anchor
(`AND` flag rule "Z 0 1 0" in Pan Docs; a gameboy-doctor truth log; the
reference matcher's output). Same-family agreement counts (11/11, 9/9, 100%) are
necessary but NOT sufficient — they prove consistency, not correctness. Record
the anchor in the fixture's provenance. See [[R6]] for the complementary rule
that the checks themselves must be falsifiable.

## R6 — golden checks must be capable of failing

Every "must pass" check gets a corrupt-and-confirm test: deliberately break the
thing it validates and confirm the check goes RED. No X-vs-X comparisons — a
check that diffs a value against itself can never fail and therefore proves
nothing.

**Why:** a gate that diffs the golden against its own default truth (no explicit
independent reference) is comparing X to X — it is green by tautology, and "the
gate is not over-strict" has never actually been demonstrated. The same failure
mode at corpus level: if expectations are regenerated in the same breath as the
reference they pin, the corpus stays green through a reference change that should
have broken it. The R-1 corpus dip (9/9 → 7/9 → 9/9) is the positive proof: the
corpus genuinely went RED the instant the golden was corrected and before the
pins were replayed — that dip is what makes the recovered 100% trustworthy.

**How to apply:**
- Each oracle ships a `run.test.sh` whose cases include at least one
  corrupt-and-confirm: feed the gate a deliberately corrupted golden and assert
  it reports `status=fail` (e.g. `evals/oracles/emulator-gb/run.test.sh`).
- A reference fix MUST make the corpus dip RED before it recovers; record the dip
  publicly (CORPUS-STATUS.md dip-log). A corpus that never went red during a
  reference fix means the expectations were regenerated in the same breath as the
  reference — stop and investigate.
- Re-pin expected verdicts by REPLAYING the input through the gate's `run.sh` and
  capturing its structured output — never hand-write a pinpoint (SCHEMA.md law).

See [[R5]] for the complementary rule that the reference itself must be
externally anchored.

## R1 — parallel agents never share an output directory
Two agents writing the same dir (e.g. `evals/corpus/`) collide: add/add merges, one set silently wins.
**Why:** H-8 build — two parallel agents both seeded `evals/corpus/`, runner scored 0/9 on the schema mismatch.
**How to apply:** planner assigns each parallel agent a DISJOINT sub-path (or, once the ledger lands, each claims its surfaces). Same-dir work is sequenced, never parallelized. This is the `claimed_surfaces` failure class, dogfooded before the ledger existed.

## R2 — never delete a worktree branch before its merge lands
**Why:** a fix branch was deleted mid-merge-conflict; the commit went dangling, recovered only via reflog sha.
**How to apply:** confirm the merge commit is reachable from main (no conflict in progress) BEFORE `git worktree remove` / `git branch -D`. Resolve conflicts first; never clean up mid-conflict.

## R3 — worktree agents must commit in-worktree
Spawned coders auto-isolate into git worktrees; uncommitted files are destroyed on cleanup.
**How to apply:** every spawned agent commits in its worktree; the orchestrator integrates by merging the branch — never by expecting files on main.

## R4 — schema/reference changes propagate in one commit and must show the dip
**Why:** a contract change with untouched expectations that stays green = the change didn't really happen (tautology).
**How to apply:** update every consumer (gates, falsify, corpus, expected fixtures, docs) in the SAME commit; run the corpus between reference-fix and re-pin to capture the RED dip; record it in CORPUS-STATUS.md dip-log. (R6 generalizes this.)

## Corpus calibration — 100% over a static corpus is just a badge
**Why:** a corpus at 9/9 forever has stopped teaching. Value = cases that FAIL when gates regress + intake of genuinely hard field/community cases.
**How to apply:** as field-capture starts, a catch-rate dip that gets fixed is the curve working — never an embarrassment to hide. The impressive artifact is a high rate over a GROWING, hardening corpus. Never game the number by keeping the corpus easy.

## R7 — cap spawned-task size; checkpoint commits mid-task
**Why:** three agents in one session (H-3, R-3.2, wave-2b) exhausted their budget (~140-165k tokens) on multi-part tasks and died BEFORE committing/reporting — work survived only because worktrees were inspected by hand before cleanup.
**How to apply:** a spawned task covers at most ~3 remediation-items or 2 domains; anything larger is split into sequenced spawns. Agents commit a checkpoint after each completed sub-item, not only at the end. The spawn framework's per-spawn token budget + partial-report flag exists for exactly this — use it once wired.

## Corpus diversification — v0.3 floor (RJ rule)
By corpus v0.3, a minimum share (target ≥1/3) of cases must originate from NEW tasks — third-domain oracles (mini-git), the popular-surface 10, field capture — not mutants of the founding two fixtures. Deepening only on founding fixtures = memorizing, not generalizing.

> **Launch-3 evidence tags:** R1 (parallel-agent output-dir collision — the `claimed_surfaces` failure class demonstrated on our own build) and R7 (budget-exhausted agents dying uncommitted — the spawn-budget/partial-report failure class) are both first-party incidents the team-lane ledger + spawn framework exist to prevent. Cite both in the Launch-3 write-up: "the days our own agents collided and died silently, and what we built so yours don't."

## R8 — gitleaks runs as a standing pre-commit gate (and a hard pre-push gate)
gitleaks runs as a standing pre-commit gate (and a hard pre-push gate), not just an ad-hoc scan — secrets are blocked at the moment of commit, before they can enter history. A one-time full-history scrub cleans the past; this gate prevents recurrence.
**Why:** a credential reached history during a near-miss (SECURITY-REMEDIATION.md Step 6.2). Scrubbing history removes the leaked secret but does nothing to stop the next one; the only durable fix is a guard at the moment a secret would be recorded.
**How to apply:** `bin/secret-scan` runs via the PreToolUse Bash hook on `git commit`, scanning the STAGED diff (`gitleaks git --staged`, falling back to `gitleaks protect --staged`, then `gitleaks stdin`). A finding blocks the commit (exit 2). At commit time a missing gitleaks WARNS-but-allows (a missing scanner must not brick every commit); at push time it is a HARD block (`--require`) — pre-push is the last line, so gitleaks-absent OR any finding refuses the push, alongside the existing falsify/corpus gates.

## R9 — set the clean commit identity before the first commit
Configure `git config user.email` / `user.name` to the project's canonical identity at project start, BEFORE any commit. A rename or history-scrub fixes the past once; commits made afterward with a stale identity (e.g. a former-employer email) silently re-introduce the fingerprint into history and get pushed.
**Why:** post-rename, ~20 session commits authored with the old `@company` email were pushed to the clean public remote — gitleaks stayed 0 (no secret) but the identity leak required a second history rewrite + force-push to undo.
**How to apply:** (1) set the canonical commit identity in the repo at setup; (2) post-push verification of a public repo is BOTH `gitleaks detect --log-opts=--all` AND `git log --all --format='%ae|%ce' | sort -u` — gitleaks alone does not catch an identity fingerprint. (3) After any history rewrite, re-sync local tags (`git tag -d … && git fetch --tags`) — `reset --hard` does not move existing tags, leaving them pointed at pre-rewrite commits.
