# Seeker — Find Bugs from Production

Pull logs from pods, analyze, raise issues on GitHub.

## Process

1. **Pull logs** from all pods in the namespace:
   ```
   kubectl logs --all-containers --since=1h -l app=<app> --tail=500
   ```
   If kubectl not available, check for log files in common locations:
   - `/var/log/`, `~/.pm2/logs/`, `docker logs`
   - Cloud: `gcloud logging read`, `aws logs`, `fly logs`

2. **Analyze** each log stream for:
   - Unhandled exceptions / stack traces
   - Error-level log lines (ERROR, FATAL, CRITICAL, panic, segfault)
   - OOM kills, restart loops, crash backoffs
   - Slow queries (>1s), timeout errors
   - 5xx HTTP responses, connection refused
   - Auth failures, rate limit hits
   - Memory/CPU warnings

3. **Deduplicate** — group similar errors by stack trace signature. Don't create 10 issues for the same NullPointerException.

4. **Raise GitHub issues** for each unique bug:
   ```
   gh issue create \
     --title "[seeker] <error type>: <brief description>" \
     --body "<structured body>" \
     --label "bug,seeker"
   ```
   
   Issue body format:
   ```markdown
   ## Source
   Pod: <pod-name> | Container: <container> | Time: <timestamp>
   
   ## Error
   <exact error message / stack trace>
   
   ## Frequency
   <N occurrences in last hour>
   
   ## Impact
   <what's affected — users, API, jobs>
   
   ## Suggested Fix
   <initial diagnosis + suggested approach>
   ```

5. **Verify old fixes** — check if previously raised issues are now fixed in production:
   ```
   gh issue list --label seeker --state open
   ```
   For each open issue:
   - Search current logs for the same error signature
   - If error NO LONGER appears in logs → the fix was deployed and worked:
     ```
     gh issue close <number> --comment "✅ Verified fixed in production — error no longer appears in pod logs (checked $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ))"
     ```
   - If error STILL appears → leave open, add comment with latest occurrence

6. **Report** summary: N logs scanned, M unique errors found, K issues created, J issues auto-closed (verified fixed).

## Rules
- Only create issues for REAL bugs — not info/debug noise
- Check existing open issues before creating duplicates: `gh issue list --label seeker`
- Include enough context to reproduce (pod, timestamp, full trace)
- Tag severity: critical (service down), high (errors spiking), medium (intermittent), low (warning)
- Auto-close issues whose errors no longer appear in production logs
